# Matlab Functions for the Grasp Force Prediction of Soft Robotic Fingers using Neural Networks

Matlab functions of three neural networks. Each of these networks predicts the grasp forces produced by one of three designs of soft robotic fingers. The networks were trained using FEA data and they produce results consistent with experimental data.
